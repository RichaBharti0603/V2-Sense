# V2Sense: Vehicle-to-Vehicle Safety Mesh

⚠️ Note: The simulation may take a few seconds to initialize on first load due to Streamlit free-tier sleeping. Please allow 10–15 seconds.



### 🧠 What is this?
**V2Sense** is a simulation of a collision detection system using Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication.  
It predicts potential collisions in real-time by simulating the position, speed, and direction of moving vehicles.
